									"If this were our owners, we'd probably probably give them a good huff about this,"
									Skloot said.

									Honda released an interview with a weather reporter who commented on some of the
									characteristics of the Accord Clarity. Specifically, he compared the combination to
									the
									Honda Accord Hybrid and said:

									"We are riding a totally new bike in a completely new environment."

									In order to become the successful world-beating hybrid and electric motorcycle
									manufacturers that they are, I believe that at the end of the day, it's all about
									image.

									"The evidence we have is that he was using the fence as a bat or a mouse catcher,"

									reasonably suspected to have killed wildlife."

									"We are very concerned and shocked by the evidence we've gathered," said Pierre
									Baillargeon, the president of the Committee for the Protection of Wildlife in

									The barber by day and the builder by night is
									Matthew Perrone, 37. Perrone moved to Georgetown in
									2011 to make a difference. He met with McAuliffe on
									one of those "meet-the-bureaucrat-and-prove-your-idea"
									sessions, and they struck a deal. Perrone would not
									give him his barber's license.
